# Project Euler
Basically all my [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) relevant codes, mainly in Python.
> You can also do Project Euler+ by HackerRank [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges).

#### Noob Notes ðŸ¤ª
Some problems are solved using sequences (lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc) which is computationally more expensive compared to assigning and modifying a constant number of variables. This is because it was done a very long time ago. For now, I've only decided to improve some, especially the first problems. Maybe more in the future.
