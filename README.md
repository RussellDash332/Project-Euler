# Project Euler
Basically all my [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) relevant codes, mainly in Python.

### Noob Notes ðŸ¤ª
Some problems are solved using sequences (lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.) which is computationally more expensive compared to assigning and modifying a constant number of variables. This is because it was done a very long time ago. For now, I've only decided to improve some, especially the first problems. Maybe more in the future.
